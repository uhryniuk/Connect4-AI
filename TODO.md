# AI

## Horizontal weirdness with AI 
- Horizontal and Vertical heuritics seem to be broken.
- horizontal is never valued it seems.

## Doesn't see "bad" moves
- When there is 2 in a row and it's the highest value
    - but there is only 1 more spot above that position.
    - The AI will pick it, even though it can't make 4 in a row..
        - For obbvious reasons this is stupid.

## More Dynamic first pics
- Perhaps assign weights to each row level
    - Consider if no good move can be made, select a new "opener"
        - This would be selecting a nother column without any coins.


# Frontend

## If AI responds with 4 in a row, game does not halt player
- The game foes not throw a "loser" banner either.
- Doesn't end game if the AI returns a winner
